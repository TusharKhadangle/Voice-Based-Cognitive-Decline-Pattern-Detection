Short Report:

1. Most Insightful Features

Filler Word Ratio: Strong indicator of disfluency (e.g., "uh/um" frequency).

Pause Duration Ratio: Longer pauses correlate with cognitive effort.

Hesitation Count: Direct measure of speech interruptions.

Spectral Centroid Variance: Reflects abnormal pitch fluctuations.

2. ML Methods & Rationale

Isolation Forest: Unsupervised anomaly detection to flag outliers without labeled data.

K-means Clustering: Identified two distinct speech patterns (fluent vs. disfluent).

PCA: Visualized high-dimensional features for interpretability.
Why? These methods prioritize interpretability and work well with small, unlabeled datasets.

3. Next Steps for Clinical Robustness

Larger Datasets: Include longitudinal data to track decline progression.

Domain Validation: Partner with clinicians to validate features against medical diagnoses.

Multimodal Features: Add neuropsychological test results and biomarkers.

Real-Time Analysis: Develop edge-compatible models for practical screening.

Ethical Safeguards: Address bias and ensure privacy for vulnerable populations.
